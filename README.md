# Train_Project
#Developer: Richmond Ampomah

#Description:The Train Scheduler Application begins with a form that requests the train name, destination, first train time, and frequency.  Once entered, the train is stored in Firebase and placed in the current train schedule.  The frequency, arrival time, and minutes away is determined by MomentJS.  Trains can then be updated or removed from the table.

#Technologies Used: HTML, CSS, Javascript, Bootstrap, Firebase, MomentJS, jQuery
